[AUR] Archlinux Package for Glue (a simple command line tool to generate CSS sprites).

Glue source: https://github.com/jorgebastida/glue/
Glue docs: http://glue.readthedocs.org/

AUR package: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/glue/

Glue's setup.py has been patched to use Pillow>=1.7.8 (instead of Pillow==1.7.8), which means it will only support Python 2.6 and 2.7.
